1.56
-----
Use new version of FrontPanel API. This comes in both x86 and x64 flavors,
so there are now two flavors of the Atticus binary.



1.57
-----

Code cleanup.
Renamed AtticusServerRuntime to AtticusServerCommunicator.
Created some subdirectories in DataStructures for organizational purposes.
Variety of small code changes, renames, deletions.

Fix to minor bugs regarding naming of default settings file in Cicero 
(inconsistent presence or absence of the .set file extension). NOTE: You may 
need to copy your default settings file to SettingsData.set when migrating 
from a previous version.


1.58
-----

Integrating MySql database support for Cicero. (Run information can be exported
to a MySql database?). Reference implementation of the database is in the 
clinamen/ directory, written by Ed Joe Su.

Recategorizing some Cicero Settings fields in the UI as part of the "Paris fork"
(these are features that are unsupported and not well integrated, but left in 
for compatability purposes.


1.59
-----

Eliminated a large number of unnecessary NI dependencies in Cicero and 
DataStructures projects, which will make compiling and running this suite 
substantially easier.

Cicero no longer uses NI WaveformGraph, thus no licensed copy of Measurement 
Studio is required to compile it.

DataStructures no longer references NI GPIB Address structure, but rather a 
new clone of the same functionality.


1.60
-----

Streamlined the build-for-distribution process, which will help avoid future
errors in producing a working Cicero build.


1.61
-----

Internal changes -- version number tracking in saved Sequence and Settings
files. This will allow for future improvements to backward compatibility
should it be necessary to make radical changes to these objects which
would break compatability without special conversion attention.

Significant UI Optimizations when adding or removing variables or pulses.

Bug fix to floating point numbers in equations. When Cicero was installed
on computers in French language mode, neither "," nor "." worked as decimal
seperators in floating numbers (ie 1.34). Now, when parsing equations,
we default to US-style seperators and ONLY "." will work.
