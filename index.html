        <span style="font-size: 12pt">Intuitive exprimental control software for atomic physics
            experiments.<br />

            <br /> 
            Key Features:<br /> 
        </span></span></strong> 
    <ul> 
        <li>Control of National Instruments cards providing analog and digital outputs, using
            an intuitive graphical user interface.</li> 
        <li>Control of other devices via RS232 ("serial") and GPIB commands.</li> 
        <li>1 - 2 microsecond time resolution on 60s long sequences, through use of variable
            frequency sample clocks to reduce buffer sizes.</li> 
        <li>Client / Server architecture, separation of UI program from hardware output program,
            allowing scaling to arbitrary numbers of output channels.</li> 
        <li>Batch processing, variable scanning, and run logging allow for automated data collection
            while eliminating tedious work.</li> 
    </ul>
