Visual Studio 2010 has a serious bug which Microsoft refuses to fix:

https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/556158/batch-build-links-to-wrong-referenced-projects

In essence, building Cicero by using Build -> Batch Build can produce bizarre
and unpredictable broken builds, depending on which Solution configuration is
selected when performing the build (this is the drop-down selection next to
Visual Studio's "run" button).

Recommended steps to workaround this bug when building Cicero for distribution:

 -- Optional Pre-Build-Cleanup --
1) Ensure that you do not have any important files within the Cicero directory
structure that are not being track by the git repository (they will get deleted
with the following command!).

2) At the git command prompt, from the top level of the Cicero git repository,
run "git -f -x -d"

-- Building --
[note -- the order of steps 4 and 5 doesn't matter, but they must come after
step 3]

3) Select "Release" as the current configuration and select Build -> Build Solution
4) Select "Atticus-Release-x86" and then Build -> Build Solution
5) Select "Atticus-Release-x64" and then Build -> Build Solution
